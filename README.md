I have created a simple taskManagerApp where i can create task, view the list of tasks, delete tasks, save tasks.
I have used the concept of serialization and deserialization for saving data into the file and retrieving data from the file.


The current implementation does follow most of thet SOLID princliples to a good extent, particularly (Single Responsibility Principle , Open/Closed Principle)
